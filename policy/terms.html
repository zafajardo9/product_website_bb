            <p>
                3.1 These Terms of Use shall take effect when the Company notifies a User of these Terms of Use by posting them on the Company’s Application or by using other methods (via text, e-mail, messenger, etc.) and the User indicates his or her consent. The membership registration is a procedure necessary to use special Services, and whether the user has registered as a member does not affect the validity of these Terms of Use.<br/><br/>
                3.2 The Company may modify these Terms of Use, if needed, to the extent that it does not violate relevant laws and regulations. In such case, the Company shall make an announcement in a manner prescribed in Article 3.1. or send individual notices to Users, regarding both the previous and modified versions of the Terms of Use, effective date, and reasons for the modification for a period starting seven (7) days before the effective date and ending one (1) day before the effective date. Provided, however, any change to a User’s significant rights or obligations shall be announced or notified to the User thirty (30) days before the effective date in a manner prescribed above.<br/><br/>
                3.3 A User shall be deemed to have accepted the modified Terms of Use in case the User does not expressly reject the modification within the above period, even after the Company has announced or notified the User of the modified Terms of Use in accordance with Article 3.2, stating that the User will be deemed to have accepted the modified Terms of Use without the User’s express rejection to the modification before the effective date of modification. A User who does not accept the modified Terms of Use may not be able to use the Services and the User may suspend use of Services and terminate the Agreement for Use within the above period.
